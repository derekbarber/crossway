          Community groups are the life blood of Crossway. It's where we share our lives together and seek to live out our calling as God's redeemed people.

          If you are looking to get more connected at Crossway then you'll want to join a Community Group. We have groups located through the Surrey, Langley and Abbotsford areas and we encourage you to join a group near you so that you can be better connected to each other.

        Connect with a Community Group
      %p
        If you would like to get connected with one of our community groups, the best place to do that is on a Sunday morning
        
        at the Info Centre. Someone will be available there to help you get connected with a community group that is near to you
        
        and you can also meet some of our leaders and get any of your questions answered about Crossway.
