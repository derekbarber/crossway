          %h4 Why does Crossway need The City?
          %p
            As the Lord grows our church, the ability for our people to live in gospel-centered community becomes more difficult. The City gives us a place to find that community and also provides smaller platforms of communications to enhance it. Ultimately, The City enables us to better be the body of Christ.

            %h4 Is The City just another social network?
            %p
              No. Popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter are geared toward individuals and their needs. The City is geared toward groups and the needs of the local church. Also, whereas most social networks create and replace community, The City merely supplements community that already exists.
