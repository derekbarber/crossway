        %strong Because of the gospel, Crossway Church exists to love Jesus, love His people and live to make Him known, all to the glory of God.

          The gospel is the story of God reconciling and redeeming a broken creation and
          fallen creatures to Himself through the life, death, resurrection and future
          return of Jesus Christ. Our hope and desire is that the gospel would stand
          at the center of all that we do. It is what directs and defines us. It is our identity.
