    <h4>At Crossway, our Childrens Ministry is built upon <a href="http://www.gospelproject.com/" target="_blank">The Gospel Project</a> curriculum:</h4>

    <br>

    <blockquote>
    <p>The Bible is not a collection of stories. It is one story, the story of God’s plan to rescue His people from sin and death. It is the story of redemption, the gospel message of Jesus Christ. And it’s our story, too.</p>

    <p>The Gospel Project is a Bible study resource that invites Adults, Students, and Kids of all ages to dive deeply into God’s story of redemption through Jesus Christ. In every lesson, participants are immersed in the gospel and learn how when the gospel works on them, they become a part of the story, too, the very hands and feet in God’s gospel project.</p>
