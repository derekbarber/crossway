    Crossway Community Church is part of growing family of close to 100 Christian churches in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Bolivia, and Ethiopia which are joined together under the banner of Sovereign Grace Ministries. With other Sovereign Grace Ministries churches we share:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A vision to establish and support local churches</li>
      <li>A passion for the gospel of Jesus Christ</li>
      <li>A commitment to our doctrinal distinctives</li>
      <li>A desire to see the members of these churches glorify God in their public and private lives-both corporately and as individuals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As part of its commitment to equip and develop local churches, Sovereign Grace Ministries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides a number of resources (such as books, teaching, and music)</li>
      <li>Holds conferences (small group, worship, leadership, New Attitude, etc.)</li>
      <li>Trains new leaders in their Pastors College</li>
    </ul>
