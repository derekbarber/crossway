    %h3 Service Ministries
    %p
      What goes on during a public worship service is dependent upon the contribution of many volunteers who are working behind
      the scenes. Our Service ministries may be less visible but they are some of the most vital components of our church.
      We are blessed to have many volunteers who serve in these various ministries week after week.
